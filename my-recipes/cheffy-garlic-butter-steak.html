        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>

        <p id="recipe-description">
            Today’s recipe is more of a technique than a recipe – but it’s one that all steak lovers
            should know because it’s easy, worthy of using on high quality steaks and also a way to
            really elevate economical steaks.

            It’s as simple as this: while the steak is searing in the pan, throw in butter, garlic and
            thyme and baste continuously as the steak finishes cooking. The garlic-thyme infused butter
            does all sorts of wonderful things to the steak, seeping into the cracks and crevices, and
            adhering to the crust of the steak.

            It’s pan seared steak made Outrageous – and that’s Outrageous with a capital “O”!

        <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Thickish cut steak:</strong>
                No more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to cook this entirely on the stove
                (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven). Ideal steaks: boneless rib eye /
                scotch fillet, porterhouse / New York, T-bone. Grade: takes high quality steak
                over the top amazing, really elevates economical steak.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Butter</strong>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Garlic</strong>
            </li>
            
            <li>

        <h2 id="steps">Preparation steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly
                rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre
                to be cooked to your liking.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form
                that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks.
            </li>

            <li>
                Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>WARNING:</strong> The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!
            </li>

            <li>
                Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below)
                because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and
            </li>

            <li>
                REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax.
                This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!
            </li>
        </ol>
