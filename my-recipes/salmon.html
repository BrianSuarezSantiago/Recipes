        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>

        <p id="recipe-description">
            Garlic butter smothered salmon is a given. It‚Äôs possibly one of the most amazing,
            delicious ways to eat a juicy piece of salmon and gets cooked twice a week in this
            house. It‚Äôs been a while since we gave you salmon and it‚Äôs time.
            
            Normally you may opt for pan seared salmon for a guaranteed crisp exterior with a
            fork tender interior. Our baked salmon recipe delivers soft, juicy and tender salmon
            on the inside with charred crisp edges. A delicious restaurant-quality dinner!

        <h2 id="steps">Preparation steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Bake your potatoes first as salmon needs less time in the oven. This way you‚Äôre
                guaranteed the potatoes will be cooked through when it‚Äôs all finished. I used
                fingerling potatoes in this recipe because we LOVE the flavour of them! You an
                also use Yukon golds or halved baby potatoes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Once your potatoes are done, push them to the side and pile on your asparagus and
                salmon pieces.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pour on all of your flavours.         
            </li>

            <li>
                Prepare an amazing garlic butter sauce with a hint of white wine (optional) and
                lemon juice.         
            </li>
        </ol>
