        <p id="recipe-description">
            I had a friend of mine who is a mom tell me that she ate this cheesecake for
            breakfast and lunch on Friday. Totally no judgment, right?! She said it was
            the perfect way to get her coffee (and breakfast & lunch) in while chasing
            after 3 littles!

        <h2 id="steps">Preparation steps</h2>

        <h4>Crust:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350¬∫ F
            </li>

            <li>
                Pulse the whole oreos (or chocolate graham crackers) in a blender or
                food processor until they are very fine. Measure out 2 cups of crumbs.
            </li>

            <li>
                In a small bowl, combine the crumbs with the melted butter, mix well until
                incorporated.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add the crumbs to a 8 or 9 inch springform pan, distribute them evenly, using
                a cup or the bottom of something flat to press the crumbs into the pan. If
                desired, you can have the crumbs go up the sides of the pan a bit.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place the pan in the oven, pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove the pan from the oven, and allow it to cool to room temperature before adding
                the cheesecake mixture. To speed this up, you can put the springform pan in the fridge.
            </li>

            <li>
                Turn the oven down to 325¬∫ F
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cheesecake:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place the round springform pan inside an oven safe bag (like one that you‚Äôd cook a turkey
                in for thanksgiving) and roll the top of the bag down so it doesn‚Äôt cover the cheesecake.
                Set aside
            </li>

            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, beat the 3 packages of cream cheese until smooth, about 2-3 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add in the sugar, vanilla extract and espresso, beat again.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add in the eggs, ONE at a time, beating just until the egg yolk breaks, then add in the next, etc.
                Beat the mixture for 1 additional minute. Do not over beat, this is why I recommend only 1 minute.
                Pour the cheesecake mixture on top of the cooled crust
            </li>

            <li>
                Place the springform pan in a 9√ó13 inch pan or larger roasting pan. Carefully fill the roasting pan
                with about 1 inch of water.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place the water bath with the cheesecake inside in the oven and bake at 325¬∫ F for 65-85 minutes *see note.
                The cheesecake is done when the center wobbles a little when you jiggle the pan. The edges of the cheesecake
                should look firmer than the center.
            </li>

            <li>
                Once the cheesecake is done baking, turn the oven off and gently remove the springform pan from the water bath
                and oven safe bag. Place the cheesecake on a baking sheet and return to the oven (oven is off) with the oven
                door cracked. Allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature inside the oven before removing ‚Äì this could be
                60-90 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Once cooled to room temperature, remove the cheesecake from the oven. Loosely cover the cheesecake with foil and
                place in the fridge overnight.
            </li>

            <li>
                Before serving, carefully unmold the cheesecake from the pan. Use a small spatula to assist any parts that are sticking
                to the pan. Allow the pan to do most of the work, some of the cheesecake may stick to the pan, but the cheesecake should
                naturally separate from the pan.
            </li>
        </ol>
